# Staging Environment Configuration (clusters/staging/)

This directory contains the Kubernetes configurations that define the desired state for the **staging environment**.

## GitOps with Argo CD

Argo CD monitors this path (or specific Application CRs defined herein) to automatically synchronize the staging cluster.

## Application Management

Applications deployed to this environment will be managed declaratively, likely using:
-   Helm charts, with environment-specific values.
-   Argo CD `Application` Custom Resources.
-   Argo CD `ApplicationSet` resources to automate the configuration of applications based on templates or Git directory structures.

The configurations here should represent a pre-production environment used for testing, QA, and validation before changes are promoted to production.
